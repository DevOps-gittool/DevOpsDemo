Apple launched its long-rumoured M1 based Macbooks back in November last year.

This marked an end to the 15-year-old alliance between intel and Apple that began in 2005. The Macbook Air that was refreshed in 2020 itself was also upgraded with the M1 chip. 

Apple claimed major improvements in performance and battery life on the Macbook M1 Air, which came out to be true. The new in-house chipset did wonders to this new Macbook Air.
